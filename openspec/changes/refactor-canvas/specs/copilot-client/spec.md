# copilot-client

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: CopilotClient enforces passive mode via SDK configuration

Passive mode SHALL continue to block arbitrary execution tools, and the Copilot client SHALL expose only host-governed UI lifecycle action interfaces required for Canvas workspace management. The client SHALL emit host-confirmed action outcomes and SHALL NOT treat assistant prose as authoritative UI state.

#### Scenario: Non-allowed tool call remains suppressed

- **WHEN** the assistant attempts to invoke a non-allowed execution tool
- **THEN** the request is suppressed and logged without approval flow

#### Scenario: Allowed UI lifecycle action emits confirmed outcome

- **WHEN** the assistant requests an allowed Canvas block lifecycle action
- **THEN** the client emits a structured success or failure outcome event generated by host-side action handling

#### Scenario: Failed lifecycle action does not mutate workspace

- **WHEN** an allowed Canvas lifecycle action returns failure
- **THEN** no workspace mutation is applied and the failed outcome is surfaced to diagnostics
