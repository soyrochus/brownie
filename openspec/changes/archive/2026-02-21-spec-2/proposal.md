## Why

SPEC-1 proved the Copilot connectivity and shell scaffolding, but it did not prove the core product risk: whether Brownie can safely render dynamic, declarative UI in the Canvas. SPEC-2 is needed now to validate deterministic schema-driven rendering and typed event propagation before adding agent intent resolution or catalog selection.

## What Changes

- Replace the right-side static "Dynamic UI will render here" placeholder with a deterministic Canvas runtime driven by a hardcoded (or embedded test) `UiSchema`.
- Introduce strict local schema deserialization and validation before rendering, with rejection for invalid schemas (unknown component types, contract mismatches, nesting and count violations).
- Render multiple concrete component types from a typed enum model, including markdown, form fields with mixed field types, code/diff content, and action buttons.
- Emit and capture structured `UiEvent` values from UI interactions and display them in a debug/log panel to prove deterministic event propagation.
- Keep chat transcript behavior functional but reposition Canvas as the primary interaction surface for this phase.
- Keep agent-driven intent resolution and catalog/template lookup explicitly out of scope for SPEC-2.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `ui-runtime`: Deterministic runtime that deserializes a declarative `UiSchema`, validates it, and renders the validated schema into the Canvas without agent or catalog involvement.
- `component-registry`: Typed component allowlist and renderer registry (`markdown`, `form`, `code`/`diff`, `button`, etc.) with rendering driven by component enums and shared rendering contracts.
- `ui-event-log`: Structured `UiEvent` emission and capture pipeline, including a debug panel that records typed interaction events generated by rendered components.

### Modified Capabilities

- `app-shell`: Replace SPEC-1's static right-panel placeholder with the runtime-backed Canvas and adjust layout emphasis so chat remains available but is no longer the primary interaction surface.

## Impact

- Affects `src/app.rs` panel composition and rendering flow by introducing a runtime-driven Canvas and associated debug/event display.
- Adds new UI runtime modules and strongly typed schema/event domain models under `src/` (new files expected for schema types, validation, registry, and runtime coordination).
- Leaves `copilot-client` integration and session persistence functional for SPEC-2, while intentionally avoiding new agent/catalog dependencies.
- Adds validation and integration tests to prove: valid schema renders; malformed schema is rejected; and user interactions produce deterministic structured `UiEvent` records.
