# Python Project Instructions

Focus on:
- Entry points: `__main__.py`, `main.py`, CLI definitions, `setup.cfg`/`pyproject.toml` scripts.
- Frameworks: FastAPI, Flask, Django, Typer, Click.
- Structure: packages in `src/`, `app/`, or top-level modules.

Evidence to extract:
- App initialization and configuration flow.
- Routing/API surfaces (FastAPI/Flask/Django urls/views).
- Data models (Pydantic/dataclasses/ORM models).
- Services and integrations (clients, adapters, SDK usage).

Doc depth:
- Each section must cite file/line evidence.
- Prefer naming concrete modules, classes, and functions.
- Map at least 3 key flows (startup, request handling, data persistence).
